Fixed unexpected upcasting to 64 bits when doing arithmetic with Python scalars
on ``numpy`` 2 (#18384).

Don't upcast ``NDData``  to ``float64`` unnecessarily when doing arithmetic
involving a single unit (consistent with the behaviour when there are no units).
Upcasting still occurs if an operand's unit gets converted to match the other,
or where required by the other operand's dtype.
